I love programming. I love persuading others to love it. I try my best to learn everything that's there in the field of Computer Science. I develop apps that can help the society and people around me in some way. My field of interest includes Internet of Things, Wireless Sensor Networks, Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, NoSQL databases and Educational Technology. I like to tinker around with latest gadgets and hence I'm a keen observer of projects on Kickstarter and have backed a few of them. 

In my free time I read about the possibilities of Alien life and the origin of the Universe and my topics of interest include Alcubierre Drive, Multiverse Theory and UFO Conspiracy Theories. Last but not the least, I love watching football and I'm a big fan of Jose Mourinho and Fernando Torres.

Jack Ma and Elon Musk are my inspirations.
