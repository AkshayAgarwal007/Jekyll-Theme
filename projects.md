### [ OPEC (One Pi Every Community) ]("") 
Inspired by the Negroponte's One Laptop Per Child and the ongoing coding revolution led by organisations like Raspberry Pi Foundation, Code.org, Coderdojo, etc and after seeing the plight of the underprivileged kids and lack of CS Education in Indian Educational System started project OPEC, where I designed a customised Raspberry Pi computer and a small curriculum for teaching coding consisting of Basics of Computer, LOGO, Blockly, Python, for 4-11 yrs kids. Donated the RPi Computer to an orphpanage and conducted workshops every weekend and taught basics of computer and coding to a group of 60 underprivileged kids over a span of two months in the summer of 2015 alongwith [Abhishek Kumar]() and [Sumit Mukherjee](). 

We also donated notebooks and had to resort to the traditional BlackBoard teaching method as a single device was not enough but the kids practiced it in turns over the week. [Sumit]("") carried on with the workshops after summer vacations and an Hour of Code was also conducted during the Computer Science Week. (Team, Project Lead)
